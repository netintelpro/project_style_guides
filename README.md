# project_style_guides

What is a Style Guide?
A style guide is the definitive documentation for a website/application that sets the rules for that site’s visual and aesthetic design.
A Style guide may be as simple as a 1 page document to a comprehensive 150 page bible detailing everything from button style to navigation structure.
The style guide should be the ‘end all be all’ for project’s design to help maintain consistency through-out life cycle and evolution of project. The style guide should dictate every part of site’s design.
Why Create A Style Guide

Keeps branding consistent across multiple apps, campaigns, teams and timelines  
Allows designers to easily reuse standard patterns and lets developers know how to make things look
Gives designers direction and constraints when creating and updating resources
Strengthens and adds value to design, message and branding.
Provide a consolidated overview of all components of websites in a single place


What to Include
SSTRATEGIC BRAND OVERVIEW 
This should be short and sweet. In as few words as possible, make clear the vision for this design and any keywords people should keep in mind while designing. Most people will probably flip straight to the picture pages, but they may read a few sentences here.

LLOGOS 
For print and Web, most brands revolve around the logo. Make sure you provide logo variations and clarify minimum sizes.

SSPACING 
Many non-designers underestimate the need for white space. Include a spacing reference, especially for the logo. Rather than specifying inches or centimeters, use a portion of the logo (a letter or a shape) to set the clearance. This way, whether the logo is big or small, the space around it will be sufficient.

CCOLORS 
Always include color palettes and what the colors should be used for. And include formats for both print and Web: CMYK, Pantones (if they exist) and RGB (or HEX). Always include a CMYK alternative for Pantones because sometimes matching is hard (especially when Pantone printing is not possible). Specify primary and secondary colours and when and where to use them.

FFONTS 
You’ll need to define the typefaces to use: sizes, line height, spacing before and after, colors, headline versus body font, etc. Make sure to include Web alternatives for non-Web fonts.


LLAYOUTS AND GRIDS 
By setting up templates and guidelines for grids, you encourage best practices and promote consistency. In Web, preparing some generic templates can curb excessive creativity with the layout.


TONE OF VOICE 
A huge component of a brand’s personality is the copy, and defining the tone is a great way to keep a brand consistent. When multiple people are writing the copy, the brand can start to sound like it has multiple personalities.


BBUTTON HIERARCHY
You’ve carefully decided what all the buttons are for and meticulously defined their states. Unfortunately, the in-house designer hasn’t applied your hover states or has created their own, and they look terrible.
Create a page that shows what all links do (including the buttons), the appropriate behavior of each and when to use them (with examples of appropriate usage). If one button is dominant, make clear the maximum number of times it should be used per page (usually once at most). Define the hover, disabled and visited states for all buttons.

IICONS
Defining size and spacing and where to use icons is another great way to promote consistency. If icons should be used only sparingly, make this clear.

NNAVIGATION (LOGGED IN/OUT STATES) 
On the Web, good consistent navigation can make or break a website. New pages are often added to a website after the designer is done with it. Have you left some space for this? Doing things like letting people know what to do with new navigation items and showing logged-in states make for a cleaner website.

BBASIC CODING GUIDELINES
There’s no way to make someone else code like you, but you can offer others basic guidelines that will minimize the damage, such as:
CSS class naming conventions
Should they use .camelCase or .words-with-dashes?
JavaScript integration
Are you using jQuery? MooTools? How should new JavaScript be integrated?
Form styling
Include the code, error states and more so that they understand what style conventions you expect.
Doc type and validation requirements
Do you allow certain invalid items? Do you expect the CSS and HTML to validate?
Directory structure
Make clear how you have organized it.
Accessibility standards
Should people include alt tags? Is image replacement used for non-standard fonts?
Testing methods
Which standard should they test with? Do you have staging and production websites?
Version control
What system are you using? How should they check in new code?
