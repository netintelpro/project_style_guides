## What is a Style Guide?
A style guide is the definitive documentation for a website/application that sets the rules for that site’s visual and aesthetic design.

A Style guide may be as simple as a 1 page document to a comprehensive 150 page bible detailing everything from button style to navigation structure.

The style guide should be the ‘end all be all’ for project’s design to help maintain consistency through-out life cycle and evolution of project. The style guide should dictate every part of site’s design.

## Why Create A Style Guide

* Keeps branding consistent across multiple apps, campaigns, teams and timelines  
* Allows designers to easily reuse standard patterns and lets developers know how to make things look
* Gives designers direction and constraints when creating and updating resources
* Strengthens and adds value to design, message and branding.
* Provide a consolidated overview of all components of websites in a single place


## What to Include

### Strategic Brand Overview
Keeping it simple and high level, using as few words as possible, clearly state the vision for this design and any key words designers should keep in mind while designing. 

### Logos
Provide logo variations and clarify minimum sizes.

### Spacing
Often overlooked by non-designers, white space reference is an important consideration, especially clearance surrounding the logo. Instead of specifying in pixels, inches or centimeters, use a portion of the logo (a letter or a shape) to set the clearance, so that regardless of the size of logo, space around it will be consistent.

### Colors
Always include color palettes and specify which colors should be used for what. Detail primary and secondary colors and when and where to apply them.

### Fonts
Completely define fonts to use, including font family, colors, sizes, line heights, spacing before and after, headings,body, paragraphs, quotes, etc. Make sure to include font-family alternatives for different browsers.

### Layouts and Grids
Designating templates and guidelines for layouts and grids, encourages best practices and consistency. 

### Tone of Voice
Another overlooked component of a brand’s personality is the copy, and defining the tone is a great way to keep a brand consistent. When multiple people are writing the copy, the brand can start to sound like it has multiple personalities.

## BUTTONS AND LINKS
Include instructions that detail how buttons and links will look at various states including hover, disabled and visited..

### Icons
Define size and spacing, where, when and how often to use icons to promote consistency. 

### Navigation(Logged in/out States)
Include instructions to guide the addition of new pages on website after initial deployment. Let future designers/developers know what to do with new navigation items including showing logged-in states.

### Basic Coding Guidelines
Include basic guidelines to keep code base consistent and more easily maintainable:
* CSS class naming conventions
* .camelCase or .words-with-dashes?
Form styling
Include the code, error states and more so that they understand what style conventions you expect.
* Doc type and validation requirements
* Do you allow certain invalid items? Do you expect the CSS and HTML to validate?
* Directory structure
* Should people include alt tags? Is image replacement used for non-standard fonts?
* Testing methods
* Which standard should they test with? Where are staging and production websites?
* Version control: What system are you using? How does team check in new code?
